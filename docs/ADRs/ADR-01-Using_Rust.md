# Title: Using Rust Programming Language | ID: 01

# Status

**Accepted** - Date of Decision: **06/08/2023**

# Context  

The decision to choose a programming language for implementing Redust is a critical one. Rust is a modern systems programming language that offers memory safety, strong concurrency support, and excellent performance. The goal of this ADR is to outline the rationale for using Rust as the programming language.

# Decision  

We will use the Rust programming language to implement our project because of Rust's safety guarantees and low-level control, which make it an ideal choice for building a system that requires efficient memory management, concurrent execution, and robustness.

## Rationale

Several factors contribute to the choice of Rust for this project:

### Memory Safety

Rust's ownership model and strict compiler checks help prevent common memory-related errors like null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races. 

### Concurrency

Redis is known for its ability to handle high levels of concurrent operations. Rust's native support for asynchronous programming through its async/await syntax and lightweight, zero-cost abstractions like `tokio` make it well-suited for building a highly concurrent system.

### Performance

Rust's zero-cost abstractions and close-to-the-metal control allow us to fine-tune for optimal performance. This is crucial for meeting the responsiveness and throughput expectations of Redust users.

### Ecosystem

Rust has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools that can facilitate various aspects, from networking and serialization to data structures and concurrency patterns.

### Long-Term Maintainability

The focus on clean code, strong type system, and comprehensive documentation in Rust helps ensure the long-term maintainability of the project, even as it evolves over time.

# Consequences

By choosing Rust as the programming language for our project, we anticipate the following consequences:

### Memory Safety

Adhering to Rust's strict memory safety rules may require additional attention to detail and potentially some adjustments in coding practices, which could lead to a slightly steeper learning curve for developers new to Rust (such as myself!).

### Performance

Implementing low-level control and memory management features might introduce some complexity in certain cases, necessitating careful consideration of memory lifetimes and ownership semantics.

### Ecosystem

Depending on the specific requirements of the project, some niche libraries or tools might be less readily available in Rust compared to more established languages.
